Figure S1: Significantly differentially expressed Monecular Functions generated by GO annotations. For each condition, we show the top-5 differentially expressed MF as determined by either mRNA or protein abundances. (A) exponential phase. (B) stationary phase. 

Figure S2: Flux changes with respect to salt stresses in stationary phase. 13 different flux were measured with respect to four different Na and five different Mg concentrations. (A) Concentrations with respect to changing Na+ concentrations. (B) Concentrations with respect to changing Mg2+ concentrations.
