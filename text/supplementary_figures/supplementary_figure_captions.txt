Figure S1: Significantly differentially expressed MG pathways. For each condition, we show the top-5 differentially expressed MG pathways as determined by either mRNA or protein abundances. (A) exponential phase. (B) stationary phase. 

Figure S2: Flux changes with respect to salt stresses in exponential phase. 13 different flux were measured with respect to four different Na and five different Mg concentrations. (A) Concentrations with respect to changing Na+ concentrations. (B) Concentrations with respect to changing Mg2+ concentrations.
