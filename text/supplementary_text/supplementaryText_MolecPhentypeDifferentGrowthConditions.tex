	\caption[Significantly differentially expressed molecular functions]
	{\textbf{Significantly differentially expressed molecular functions, as determined by GO annotations.} For each condition, we show the top-5 differentially expressed molecular functions according to either mRNA or protein abundances.  Empty boxes indicate that no differentially expressed pathways were found. The arrows next to pathway names indicate the proportion of up- and down-regulated genes among the significantly differentially expressed genes in this pathway. One up arrow indicates that 60\% or more of the genes are up-regulated, two arrows correspond to 80\% or more genes, and three arrows correspond to 95\% or more genes being up-regulated. Similarly, down arrows indicate the proportion of down-regulated genes. (A) Exponential phase. (B) Stationary phase.}
