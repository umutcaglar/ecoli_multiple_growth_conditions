	{\textbf{Flux changes with respect to salt stresses in exponential phase.} 13 different flux were measured with respect to four different Na and five different Mg2+ concentrations. (A) Concentrations with respect to changing Na+ concentrations. (B) Concentrations with respect to changing Mg2+ concentrations. There is no significant trend of increase or decrease in exponential phase flux measurements with respect to either Mg2+ or Na+ concentrations after fdr correction for multiple testing. Correction. The only significant trend was for labelled CO2 EC branch at exponential phase with respect to Mg2+ concentrations before multiple testing (P=.02), but even for this branch, after multiple testing correction corresponding p value increases to .4.}
