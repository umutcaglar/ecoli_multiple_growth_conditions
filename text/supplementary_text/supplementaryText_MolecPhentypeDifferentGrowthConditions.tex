	\caption[Significantly differentially expressed molecular functions]
	{\textbf{Significantly differentially expressed molecular functions, as determined by GO annotations.} For each condition, we show the top-5 differentially expressed molecular functions according to either mRNA or protein abundances. The arrows near pathway names indicate the ratio of significantly up and down regulated genes. if 95\%, 80\%, 60\% or more of the significantly changed genes are up/down regulated then the pathway is labeled with 3, 2, 1 up/down arrows respectively.(A) Exponential phase. (B) Stationary phase.}
