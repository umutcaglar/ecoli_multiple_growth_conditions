ecoli_multiple_growth_conditions
the main repository for E.coli multiple growth condition experiments.


The folder mainly composes of 5 differs categories of folders

a.) dataPreperation_RNA&Protein
b.) histogram_RNA&Protein
c.) change_wrt_variables_RNA&Protein
d.) Mf_Pathway_Analyze
e.) Flux_Analyze

each category have 3 sobfolders "code", "results", "figures"
For each category script files are inside code folders the result files are inside "results" folders and figures are in "figures" folders.

As an example "c_figures" folder includes figures generated by the the files in the folder "c_code_change_wrt_variables_RNA&Protein"

In addition to them we have data folders named 
 DoublingTimeRawData
 Flux_reads_06_21_2016
 Protein_reads_06_16_2016
 RNA_reads_06_13_2016
which includes data files that are associated with doubling time, flux, protein and ran reads 

We also have a text folder that includes stuff related with manuscript and a dictionary folder that includes files that map "YP" names for proteins to "ECB" names for RNA's

Protein and RNA raw files are txt files that includes counts and gene / protein names

THE PIPELINE MAINLY FOLLOW ALPHABETICAL ORDER in folder category name "a", "b", "c", "d", "e"

A- dataPreperation_RNA&Protein
Aim is to combine distinct count files into single unique ones for mRNA and proteins; then generate the meta data file associated with them. 

B- histogram_RNA&Protein this folder generate heat map figures for proteins and for ran. Also calculates the table1

C- change_wrt_variables_RNA&Protein

the aim of the folder is to find enriched genes with help of DeSeq2 for given datasets.


D- Mf Pathway Analyse 
   Aim of the folder is to generate some figures and edited tables from results of DAVID runs

E- FLUX Analysis 
   Aim of this folder is to do the flux data analysis.
   FluxSaltStressAnalyze.R generates concentration vs flux figures for RNA and Proteins and for exponential (figS23) and stationary phases.
