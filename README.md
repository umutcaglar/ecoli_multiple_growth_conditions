The repository consists primarily of five different groups of folders, labeled with `a_`, `b_`, `c_`, `d_`, and `e_`, representing five different stages of the analysis. For each group, there is a `code` folder that holds all the code, a `results` folder that holds all generated output datafiles, and a `figures` folder that holds all generated figures.

As an example, the folder `c_figures` includes the figures generated by the code in the folder `c_code_change_wrt_variables_RNA&Protein`.

In addition to these five groups of folders, we have data folders named:
 
- `RNA_reads_06_13_2016`: contains RNA abundances
- `Protein_reads_06_16_2016`: contains protein abundances
- `DoublingTimeRawData`: contains doubling times
- `Flux_reads_06_21_2016`: contains flux data

We also have a folder `text` that contains the manuscript and a folder `dictionary` that includes files that map "YP" names for proteins to "ECB" names for RNAs.

Protein and RNA raw files are txt files that includes counts and gene / protein names.

The analysis pipeline follows alphabetical order in the code folders:

a) `dataPreperation_RNA&Protein`: The code in this folder combines distinct count files into single unique ones for mRNA and proteins; then it generates the meta data file associated with them.

b) `histogram_RNA&Protein`: This folder generates heat map figures for proteins and for RNA. Also calculates table 1.

c) `change_wrt_variables_RNA&Protein`: The code in this folder finds differentiall expressed genes using DeSeq2.

d) `Mf_Pathway_Analyze`:  The code in this folder generates figures and edited tables from results of DAVID runs.

e) `Flux_Analyze`: The code in this folder performs flux data analysis.  `FluxSaltStressAnalyze.R generates` concentration vs flux figures for RNA and proteins.

More details about the analysis pipeline can be found in the file  `instructions_for_pipeline.docx`.
